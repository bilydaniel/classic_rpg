 if a functions gets inlined out of debugging use this:

jblow + casey:
   the player must be able to have a plan and execute it, not always the same plan -> boring
   what is the list of things the player has to understand, what is the space of the game
   how to comunicate the space? (in my case its gonna be mostly the skillchains)
   dificulty vs complexity (stats vs skillchains)
   combinations of differents things, enemies
   make the map matter, even when random generated

   make interesting map, make 3 monster types, combine them in the fight
   balance based on time? rng? some sort of seed? meta changes every run
   each run roll a bit different stats? maybe each drop has a bit different stats?
