gonna need to refactor the whole game / context mess, research jblow first
    hardcode ui?
    use file scope
    use global scope




have a look at how jblow codes, see what i can learn from it, make notes:
    most bugs are because the state isnt what you think it is, thats why its a good idea to not split into smaller functions(you cant call them)

start using the entitymanager
do an overall refactor 
start using the profiller that i made in computer enhance, start to make decisions based on actual numbers

STOP SENDING CTX EVERYWHERE, GONNA HAVE to FIX SOME APIS
0. UI final fantasy like ui, only use keyboard, dont do mouse
1. Refactor state machine, split out functions a lillte bit more(handle funcitons are too big), refactor input system
2. Mouse input
3. start using ids, instead of sending pointer, dangerous if an entity dies or something
4. better error handling(sometimes I check error in the caller, sometimes in the callee)
5. magic numbers


TO RESEARCH:
go through the examples I saved



figure out how to work with assets(tiles) better

random generation world + entities

how to work with enemies, types, how to instantiate, spawn etc

figure out some better input system (event system + queue?)

fix entities position(level + pos)

better way of connecting levels, kinda wierd right now

General refactor, alot of stuff that needs fixing or looking at
