STOP SENDING CTX EVERYWHERE, GONNA HAVE to FIX SOME APIS
0. UI final fantasy like ui, only use keyboard, dont do mouse
1. Refactor state machine, split out functions a lillte bit more(handle funcitons are too big), refactor input system
2. Mouse input
3. start using ids, instead of sending pointer, dangerous if an entity dies or something
4. better error handling(sometimes I check error in the caller, sometimes in the callee)
5. magic numbers


TO RESEARCH:
go through the examples I saved



figure out how to work with assets(tiles) better

random generation world + entities

how to work with enemies, types, how to instantiate, spawn etc

figure out some better input system (event system + queue?)

fix entities position(level + pos)

better way of connecting levels, kinda wierd right now

General refactor, alot of stuff that needs fixing or looking at
