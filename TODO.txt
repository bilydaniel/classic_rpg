figure out how to work with assets(tiles) better
random generation world + entities
how to work with enemies, types, how to instantiate, spawn etc
figure out some better input system (event system + queue?)
fix entities position(level + pos)
better way of connecting levels, kinda wierd right now

General refactor, alot of stuff that needs fixing or looking at
