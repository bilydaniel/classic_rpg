player is gonna be a puppetmaster, with his puppets as an army
the player himself doesent fight, can swap into a combat mode
where puppets enter the level,

puppetmaster will get a penalty for moving(puppets cant move this turn)
finding new puppets and  new pieces of puppets, crafting gear for them etc.
butchering monsters + gathering resources from stuff like chairs, crafting parts for the
puppets, maybe in the style of cogmind?

Puppetmaster is gonna be a combination of engineer and a necromancer
Butchering enemies, destroying stuff like chairs and crafting
dark magic like fear to protect the puppetmaster from enemies

If a puppet dies you loose it permanently

Getting a puppet should be certain (like each level) + some rare chance of getting extra one
from loot or something
